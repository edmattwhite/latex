LaTeX Lecture Notes
===================

A template project to use in Visual Studio Code for reproducible lecture notes.

Uses the `tufte-handout` class from the [Tufte-LaTeX project](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/) project, and the [LaTeX Workshop extension](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) to make pretty notes quickly.
